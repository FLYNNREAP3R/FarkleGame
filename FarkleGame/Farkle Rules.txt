Before we get into the main rules of the game, let's go over the points system.
 Roll a 1 = 100 points
 Roll a 5= 50 points
 Roll a three of a kind = The number on the face of the fice multiplied by 100.
  (Roll three 2s = 200 points)
 Roll three 1s = 1000 points

Rules:

1: Player one will roll all six dice at the same time and will set aside any 'point dice'.
   At this point the player has the option to either end their turn and collect the points
   or they can roll the remaining dice for the possibility to gain more points.

2: A "Farkle" occurrs when the dice are rolled and no point dice appear. At this point the player
   loses allthe  point dice he/she/it has collected during that turn, and the play passes to the
   next player. No points are recorded for the player.

3: If a player decided not to risk rolling a "Farkle" then he//she/it can stop rolling and the
   play passes to the next player. Any points collected during that turn are then recorded.

4: If, in the course, all six dice become 'point dice'and are set aside, the player must roll
   all six dice at least one more time, before stopping and keeping the points collected.

Entering the game: 

In order for a player to initially enter the game, he/she/it must continue to roll until at least
1000 points  are collected during one turn. Once the player oficcially enters the game, the points
are recorded and that player may stop rolling at any time during future turns. 

Winning:

To win, a player muyst reach a grand total of 10,000 points recorded. Once a player reaches a score
of over 10,000 points, each player has one turn to try and beat the first player to go out. If no
one can beat their score, then they are declared the winner! If someone is able to best their score 
though then said new player wins the game.
